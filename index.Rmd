# Welcome

I am a graduate student at Bowling Green State University studying Applied Statistics. In May 2020, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Actuarial Science from Grace College.

\

I have a passion for the intersection of math and sports, and hope to make a career in the sports world one day. My preferred sport is baseball, but college football, hockey, and golf are also pretty high on my list.
